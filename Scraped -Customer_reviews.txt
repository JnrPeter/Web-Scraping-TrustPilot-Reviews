Review_Title:Yea it’s real 
reviews:So basically I thought the company was a scam. I figured to just send them my blacklisted phone anyway because I couldn’t sell it privately, meaning I already couldn’t get anything for it. Turns out it was real and I got paid for the exact price they gave me in the quote. Payout timing and all other details were exact. Really good customer support service as well.

Review_Title:Top $ for 13 Pro Max w Front/Back Damage

I got over 20 quotes and looked at comparables on eBay even trade in offers and I was able to get in Cash was double anyone else offered.

Review_Title:Black List is not the end of the world 
reviews:I purchased a 2 month old iphone 13 pro from fb marketplace. Seller said need to sell quick low price. I tried my sim card , phone was mint , deal looked ok. The phone worked for 3 days , then just stopped working. I fell for the lost my phone insurance replacement scam. It ended up on blacklist. I looked for ways to remove lock , nothing worked. I found selllocked.com and figured I would give them a shot. Worse case would be phone returned to me and I would use as second phone fot everything like fb , amazon , etc. except calls. i filled out online form , waited for email with instructions and printed out label for UPS, I boxed it up , took it to UPS store and received email from UPS that package had been delivered after 4 days. 2 days later received email from selllocked that unit has been accepted and check will be mailed out. I received check from USPS after 4 days , deposited in bank and life is good.
