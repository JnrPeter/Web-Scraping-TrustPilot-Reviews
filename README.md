## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Selllocked is an electronic store that buys New or Used iPhone. They purchase devices that are still under finance, have a bad IMEI, are activation locked, or contain no locks at all. In this Project, I performed a web scrape of their customer reviews from their site page on trust pilot. The data gathered can be used for consumer analysis to help companies to gain an understanding of what their prospective clients or customers like or hate.
